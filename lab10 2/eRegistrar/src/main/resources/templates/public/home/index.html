                The MIU Admissions Office welcomes online applications at any time for our undergraduate, graduate,
                and non-degree programs.
                Once you submit the application form, youâ€™ll be connected with your admissions counselor who will guide
                you through the rest of the process.
                MIU has rolling admissions, which means we review applications for acceptance year-round,
                once the applicant has completed the required materials.
            </p>
